# June 11th: Started working on the schematic!
Opened up KiCAD and, after looking through some online references, like the onboard guide, started to place components.

However, I soon realised that:
1. KiCAD does not have all the components that I would require in its library, and
2. Also, the board would require PCBA,

so instead, I shifted to EasyEDA.

I added all the components that best fit my requirements and started wiring them, but when trying to rotate one component, I accidentally reloaded the page, so all progress was lost (learned that EasyEDA does not auto save your work the hard way) :(

Now I am downloading the desktop app and will continue with the schematic tomorrow!

**Time spent: 2 hours**
